Docker Containers

Beyond this repo, there are some other projects that I've created that come
with their own docker configs.  Those are:
* [camect-connector](https://github.com/bdwilson/camect-connector)
* [raincloudy-flask](https://github.com/bdwilson/raincloudy-flask)
* [ecovacs-api](https://github.com/bdwilson/ecovacs-api)

# Notes

I typically install my docker containers under /var/docker, so you'll see that
referenced in the shell scripts.
